Swift files for Lock Screen Map Tweak w/ https://github.com/Tr1Fecta-7

## What is this?

This swift project will be utilized for a jailbreak tweak created by Tr1fecta (https://github.com/Tr1Fecta-7). This concept was requested by the community (https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/f8ureh/request_if_possible_could_someone_make_a/) and this is our attempt to recreate it and make something new/unique. SwiftUI has never been implemented into a jailbreak tweak prior to this project. The xcode project in this repository contains swift files for the lock screen map view itself. See below for images.
